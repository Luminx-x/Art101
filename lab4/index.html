			<h1>Challenge</h1>
			<p>The challenge for this lab was to create psuedocode for a task. Both for a task we do in our everyday lives we are very comfortable with, as well as a computer program.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="problems">
			<h1>Problems</h1>
			<p>The biggest problem we had was figuring out exactly how we wanted the flow of information to work. After we brainstormed the pieces it was just a matter of putting them together correctly.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="results">
			<h1>Results</h1>
			<p>Below is our pseudocoding!</p>
			<pre><code>
/***

Print the options for the game
	1 - Rock
	2 - Paper
	3 - Scissors

Ask users input for which one they would like to pick
	Verify that the input is correct, otherwise loop back to 2
Bot randomly picks a number between 1-3
	1 - rock
	2 - paper
	3 - scissors
Print the winner is based on who won with these parameters
	Rock
		Rock beats paper
	Paper
		Paper beats rock
	Scissors
		Scissors beats paper
	Draw - both input value are the same
		Loop back to 2
Ask the user if they want to replay
	If yes loop back to 1
	If no end the game
